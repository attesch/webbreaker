## Introduction `introduction`

### Description `description`
Build non-functional security testing, into your software development and release cycles! WebBreaker provides the capabilities to automate and orchestrate Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) from a single client.

## User Guide `user-guide`

### Installation: `installation`

#### Quick Local Installation 
Install WebBreaker from source.
* ```git clone https://github.com/target/webbreaker```
* ```cd webbreaker```
* ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
* ```python setup.py install```

Install WebBreaker with Linux/MacOS pyinstaller.
* ```git clone https://github.com/target/webbreaker```
* ```cd webbreaker```
* ```python setup.py pyinstaller```

Install WebBreaker with Windows pyinstaller.
* ```git clone https://github.com/target/webbreaker```
* ```cd webbreaker```
* ```Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted```
* ```Powershell.exe -executionpolicy unrestricted -command build.ps1```
* ```python setup.py windows```

#### Package Install
WebBreaker releases are packaged on github.com and can be installed locally.
* ```pip install -e git+https://github.com/target/webbreaker.git#egg=webbreaker```

### Supported Features: `supported_features`

* _Jenkins global environmental variable inheritance with scan options._
* _WebInspect REST API support for v9.30 and above._
* _Export both XML and FPR WebInspect formats to Fortify Software Security Center (SSC) or other compatible vulnerability management web applications for vulnerability analysis/triage._
* _Ability to automatically upload scan results to Fortify SSC or other third-party vulnerability management software._
* _Centrally administer all configurations required to launch WebInspect scans from a [GIT](https://github.com/webbreaker/webinspect) repository._
* _Configurable ~/.webbreaker/config.ini property file to support your Fortify, WebInspect, and ThreadFix orchestration._
* _Enterprise scalability with configurable Just-In-Time (JIT) scheduling to distribute your WebInspect scans between two (2) or greater servers._
* _ChatOps extensibility and [email notifications](.webbreaker/config.ini) on scan start and completion._
* _Local [logging](.webbreaker/log) of WebInspect scan state._

### Logging `logging`
WebBreaker local logs may be found under `~/.webbreaker/logs` and can be implemented with Elastic Stack for log aggregation. Recommended compenents include Filebeat agents installed on all WebInspect servers, forwarding to Logstash, and visualized in Kibana. General implementation details are [here](https://qbox.io/blog/welcome-to-the-elk-stack-elasticsearch-logstash-kibana/).  A recommended approach is to tag log events and queries with ```WebInspect``` and ```webbreaker```, but remember 
queries are case sensitive.

### Docker `docker`
Run WebBreaker in Docker from the repository's root directory, the pre-configured virtualenv environments are `venv27` for Python 2.7 or `venv36` for Python 3.6.  Examples are illustrated below.

```
docker build -t test_env:centos . \
&& docker create -it --name test_env test_env:centos  \
&& docker start test_env \
&& docker exec -it test_env bash
```
To remove the environment gracefully, perform the following command:
```
docker stop test_env && docker rm test_env
```

### Testing `testing`
Our automated testing is performed with tox and detox on Python 3.6 and 2.7.

#### Requirements
1. Be in your project root to run tests. 
    * ```pip install -rrequirements.txt```
2. Python2.7 and Python3.6 are currently tested in our tox.ini file
    * If you want to test it against your current version python, you can the other ways to test. Tox is 
    suggested though. 
    
#### Tox
We use detox instead of tox for the speed of concurrent testing. With the speed of testing, comes a lack of 
coverage output
* ```detox```

Tox will allow you to see the coverage.py results.
* ```tox```

#### Other ways to test
These can test against your version of python without creating seperate virtualenv. For isolation of issues 
and ease of use it is suggested that you use tox. 
```
python setup.py install
pytest
```
```
python setup.py install
python setup.py test
```

### Notifications
WebBreaker provides notifications or email for start-scan and end-scan events. 

The email notifier merges the provided event data into an HTML email message and sends the message. All SMTP-related 
settings are managed under your user's home directory within the `~.webbreaker/config.ini`, and read during the webbreaker execution.

If an error occurs on behalf of the notifiers at any point during the process of creating or sending 
notifications, the event will be logged, without any interruption of WebBreaker execution or the WebInspect scan.

## Configuration

Below is the default config.ini that is set at first time install, once you execute `webbreaker` for the first time.  All subsequent installs and updates will not update your `~/.webbreaker/config.ini` unless it is deleted.  You will need to modify the appropriate sections to your environment specifications.

## Usage 
Webbreaker utilizes a structure of upper-level and lower-level commands to enable interaction with multiple 3rd party platforms. The three Products currently supported are WebInspect, ThreadFix, and Fortfiy and they can be accessed using their respective upper-level commands. Webbreaker supports multiple functions for each Product which are accessed via lower-level commands. The current command structure is listed below.

- webbreaker
    - webinspect
        - scan
        - servers
        - list
        - download
        - proxy
        - wiswag
    - fortify
        - list
        - upload
        - scan
        - download
    - admin
        - credentials
        - clear
    - threadfix
        - list
        - teams
        - applications
        - upload

A proper Webbreaker command utilizes the structure 'webbreaker [webinspect|fortify|threadfix|admin] [lower-level command] [OPTIONS]'

### FAQs `faqs`
_Question:_ Why would I receive a 401 error that I am NOT authorized to perform WebInspect scan?

_Answer:_ Either your credentials are not valid, or you need to configure the `[webinspect]` config.ini section with the following:
    
    authenticate = true
    
Now follow these two steps.
1. `webbreaker admin credentials --webinspect --clear`
1. `webbreaker admin credentials --webinspect`
    
### Commands `commands`
Below are common command-line usage of webbreaker, command structure includes the supported webbreaker Product (i.e. webinspect, fortify, threadfix, and admin) followed by an action you wish to take on the Product, typically scan, upload, download, or list.  We used WebInspect [Zero Bank](http://zero.webappsecurity.com/) for our examples below.
